#### Description:
ShortCat is a shortcut manager website that allows users to create and manage clickable links to their favorite websites. To use the website, users simply need to input the name and URL of the website they want to create a shortcut for. Once the shortcut has been created, it will appear as a clickable link with the website's logo on the ShortCat home page.

Users can easily access their saved shortcuts by clicking on the link from the home page, which will take them directly to the website. The website's user-friendly interface makes it easy for users to quickly find and access the websites they need, saving them time and effort.

ShortCat's intuitive interface and robust feature set make it simple to create, edit, and manage your shortcut links, so you can spend less time navigating the web and more time getting things done.

Shortcat automatically extracts the link of the logo of the user inputed website from its URL. This feature helps to create a visual bookmarking system that organize your favorite sites in a more visually appealing way.

Overall, ShortCat is a useful and convenient tool for anyone looking to streamline their internet browsing experience by quickly and easily accessing their favorite websites.
